# Machine learning model to accurately classify whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?	
## Performed the following steps:
* Missing data handling
* Data Preprocessing (with an explanation of why you are doing that particular step).
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Features Extraction
* Model building
* Code Commenting
* Documentation

## Some details about the dataset:

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

* SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

* Insulin:2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

* DiabetesPedigreeFunction:
It provided some data on diabetes mellitus history in relatives and the genetic relationship of those relatives to the patient. This measure of genetic influence gives an idea of the hereditary risk one might have with the onset of diabetes mellitus.
